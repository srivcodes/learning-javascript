### What is JavaScript??
- JS has nothing to do with JAVA but would rather make more sense to call it ECMA Script
- adds behaviour and interactivity
- it's a scripting language that is intentionally limited....limited how?? it cannot communicate with a database directlybor with a file system.
- it does well at manipulating web pages

### JS is a Client side language
this means that when we enter a URL on the Browser/Client it communicates with the Server and fetches the page and gives(serves) it back to the Client.

- JS can enhance audience experience but not a good idea to rely on JS to add core functionality

### JS Syntax and Rules
- JS is case sensitive
- Statements runt from Left to right and program runs from top to bottom
- a `;` means the end of a statement...preferably pun in a new line for a new statement
- whirespace and line-breaks have no value as such
- order in which you write your JS matter.

### where to put in your JS
- in case of a single page where there is no much js written you can put in your js within a `<script>` tag at the end of the body of the html file
- when there are multiple-pages, you can make a sperate file ending with a `scriptfile.js` and link it to the script tag as such: `<script src="scriptfile.js"></script>`
and write the JS code in the seperate file.

### google dev tools
#### Under Inspect
- **Elements** tab - usually all the html elements are shown here also highlights elements on the page when you hover on the tags.<br>
- **Resourses** tab - usually script is read over here
- **Console** tab - probably the most used one where one can type live JS on the browser. And errors from code is thrown up here. So Debugging is done from here.

Note: `>_` a button that looks like this on the top right corner of the resource tab opens up the console under the resource tab...makes it easier to debug.
